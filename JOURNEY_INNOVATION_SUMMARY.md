- **Holographic Text Effects**: Multi-color shifting text animations

#### 🎭 **3. Interactive Node System**
- **Spinning Timeline Nodes**: Icon containers with rotation animations
- **Particle Burst Effects**: 8-particle explosion on hover interactions
- **Pulsing Glow Rings**: Dynamic shadow and glow effects
- **Smart Icon Integration**: React Icons with contextual animations

#### 🎨 **4. Enhanced UI/UX Design**
- **Glassmorphism Cards**: Backdrop blur with semi-transparent backgrounds
- **Tricolor Theme Integration**: Consistent orange (#F97316) and green (#22C55E) palette
- **Responsive 3D Effects**: Adaptive animations based on screen size
- **Performance Optimizations**: Reduced motion support for accessibility

#### 📊 **5. Rich Content Display**
